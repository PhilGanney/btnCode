			Welcome to btnCode, a pet project by Ipswich based web developer Phil Ganney. I started work on this in October 2022, and intend to continue adding to fairly regularly for the rest of 2022, maybe into 2023 if other people use it. It is, intentionally, a very different way of creating code - another tool in the software developers toolkit. If it makes no sense, <a href="https://github.com/PhilGanney/btnCode/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank">view the readme</a>.

				<h2>Starting notes and assumptions</h2>
				<p>Overall we need inputs for each of the parts of the JS object used for btns</p>
				<p>There are two variations of the format:<br/>groups use "jsKey": [lvlInt, "group", "Text to go on the btn", ["jsKeyForBtn1", "jsKeyForBtn2" etc]]<br/>
				codeBtns use "jsKey": [lvlInt, "codeBtn", "Text to go on the btn", "text to insert"]</p>
				<p>
				lvlInt should be set to 0 if you want this btn showing when the lang has been chosen. For showing only when a groupBtn has been tapped, any other value could be used, but by convention I use 1. At least by current implementation, at time of writing (and seems unlikely to change), lvlInt is only checked when a lang is chosen (as a way of knowing which btns need to be shown). If we were to have nested groups, that could probably be achieved by simply setting the nested group btns to lvlInt 1 (or any lvlInt that isnt 0) and listing the nested group keys in their parent group, just like any codeBtn in that group
				</p>
				<p>Though there are only really two btn types in the codeBtn div at the moment, I have thoughts for this btnMkr doing more than those types in the maybe not so distant future. </p>
				<h2>First prototype learnings, thoughts, verdict</h2>
				<p>I initially tested this prototype by using it to create a couple of group btns as well as a few btns during dev. This prototype doesn't really inspire much usage - I immediately wish I was adding a bunch at a time, later thoughts add that maybe one at a time could be alright to use but only if they were immediately in the UI. It feels silly to do one at a time. Prototype 2 will look into an editable table approach. It is also seems intuitive at this point, that adding a lang to btnCode is an extension of adding btns, in terms of markup and JS scripts needed to make that happen.
