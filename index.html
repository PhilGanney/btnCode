			Welcome to btnCode, a pet project by Ipswich based web developer Phil Ganney. I started work on this in October 2022, and intend to continue adding to fairly regularly for the rest of 2022, maybe into 2023 if other people use it. It is an experimental work in progress. If it makes no sense, <a href="https://github.com/PhilGanney/btnCode/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank">view the readme</a>.

			<h3>Progress: barely functional demo</h3>
			Sunday 2nd October 2022: domain online and initial prototyping.<br/>
			Monday 3rd October 2022: basic, barely functional JS demo.<br/>
			Tuesday 4th October 2022: code now goes on multiple lines - made some progress on whitespace, but turned out to be more complex than it first looked.<br/>
			Wednesday 5th October 2022: tabs are now only 4 spaces - for some reason textarea default is 8.<br/>
			Friday 7th October 2022: text indentation kinda: text inserted by the buttons will have the same number of tabs on each line as the number of tabs in a row from where the cursor was<br/>
			Monday 10th October: A) better text indentation for button made text. (Now counts tabs from last new line before cursor to first non tab character after that new line) <br/>
			B) More JS codeblock buttons<br/>
			Tuesday 11th October: Added some basic CSS buttons
			<!--<h3>Currently working on:</h3> Making the JS demo nicer to use! <br/>
			I had wanted a copy-all button, but adding to clipboard via JS requires HTTPS if not run locally, so while this is a fun little pet project that isnt going to happen. -->
