# btnCode
 Button Code - a very different UI for coding.

#Why
Text editors and IDEs are pretty great for coding if all of these conditions are true:
 - You are working at a device with a good keyboard
 - You are physically able to type at a reasonable speed
 - Knowing what to type, comes quickly to you for that particular language
 
But what if you get a moment of inspiration while not near a good keyboard? Wouldn't it be great to be able to use your phone, or a tablet, or whatever; without getting frustrated about trying to type. A UI that minimizes the need for typing can help with that. 

What if you get the blue screen of death, or the pinwheel of death, or a kernel panic? All OSs fail sometimes and it would be handy to be able to keep working. Switching to some other device might well be the quickest way to get going again. Particularly if you can just use a device that is already on and in your pocket.

What if you're learning a new programming language, or using some language you don't use often? A UI with buttons of core coding concepts, that can give you the outline code for you to fill in could save time looking in reference guides or typing things out multiple times till they look right.

What about people with injuries or disabilities that make large amounts of typing painful, difficult or impossible? Maybe btnCode can help?

#maybe further down the road
Some of us make the most, of less than great setups (like bootstrappers, students, and coders from the developing world). It would be great for these people, and therefore innovation as a whole, if btnCode can help smooth over some of the issues of trying to code on slow or unreliable hardware, by being seemless to switch back and forth cross device.
