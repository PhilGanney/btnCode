# btnCode

 Button Code - a very different UI for coding.

#Why

Text editors and IDEs are pretty great for coding if all of these conditions are true:
 - You are working at a device with a good keyboard
 - You are physically able to type at a reasonable speed
 - Knowing what to type, comes quickly to you for that particular language
 
But what if you get a moment of inspiration while not near a good keyboard? Wouldn't it be great to be able to use your phone, or a tablet, or whatever; without getting frustrated about trying to type. A UI that minimizes the need for typing can help with that. 

What if your main coding rig freezes or fails in a productivity killing way? Switching to some other device might be the quickest way to get going again. Particularly if you can just use a device that is already on and in your pocket.

What if you're using an unfamiliar language? A UI with buttons of core coding concepts, that give you the outline code for you to fill in, could save time.

What about people with injuries or disabilities that make large amounts of typing painful, difficult or impossible? Maybe btnCode can help?
