                    <h1>Test articles at the moment</h1>
                    <p>All the articles here are either Lorem ipsum filler text, or stuff I have put in easily to get closer to the gyst of a blog. I don't have much experience of writing blog posts, and I am still a long way from having blog writing tools that are good to work in.
                    </p>
                    <p>Titles at the moment will be ones that kind of fit an article concept I have, the text at the moment will be what I have typed up, sometimes straight into HTML in VScode, possibly sometimes copied in from google docs or whatever, but I don't have this connected up to a proper blog writing tool yet. Will I build one? Will I take this page as a starting point for a wordpress theme and use a tool that millions of people have used and hundreds of people have improved on for decades? Will I find a productive way to write the articles in some existing tool and then extract them into this? - Whos knows right now!!</p>
                    <p>That also means that much of the content on this at the moment is very much early stage draft content.</p>

                    <h1>Rabbit hole: colour schemes</h1>
                    <p>In this context, by "rabbit hole" I mean a topic that seems straightforward at first glance, but as you get into it, you find more and more things to learn or consider.</p>
                    <p>Choosing colour schemes for websites and apps might seem to be a simple case of picking colours that look pretty, but what about having good contrast for readability? Or using accent colours to help certain things pop out? Or the psycology of certain colours? Or colourblindness accessability?</p>
                    <p>Colours actually do require a bit of thought then. Different designs require different thought into the colours used.</p>
                    <p>When I was working on my tearounder app, I didn't have to consider readability of colours much - most of the text in the UI is black and on a white or light grey background. I did however, have to think about picking a good brand colour for Tearounder that could be incorporated into the design as well as the logo, and from that, find colours to help distinguish areas. The main brand colour was #99b433 - a nice leafy green colour much like you might see on a tea leaf. Greens are often relaxing, and make people think of nature, and healthy food. I also considered how the logo, in app icon form, would be easy to find in amongst other apps when a user needs it.</p>
                    <p>I used white text on a dark blue background for an info/help button Chrome dev tools gives 8.59 contrast.</p>
                    <p>Recently, since working on the epicFalling web animation, I have found myself delving into colour theory again. To make colours in that animation really pop, have an interesting pattern in background colours and have easily readable text; I made a pallete of twelve high saturation colours at even points around the colour wheel. Then I assigned those colours amongst the backgrounds and text of 6 divs, using a pattern that means that each div has text 60 degrees around the colour wheel from the background (for good contrast), and the backgrounds alternate from being 30degrees and 90degrees round from the previous background. (if this is interesting, you should have a look at the source code of it)</p>
                    <p>While trying to figure out the answer to the question "How do I calculate ratios, in a way that I could use to have JS or CSS automatically choose text colours for given background?" I found this <a href="https://medium.muz.li/the-science-of-color-contrast-an-expert-designers-guide-33e84c41d156">article by Justing Baker</a> It took me about 10 min to read since there was a fair amount of concepts that I had to think through to properly understand and see how they map to my experience.</p>

                    <h1>Easing Reacts learning curve <span role="doc-subtitle">(1&nbsp;of&nbsp;?)</span></h1><!--1 of ? is kind of a subtitle, but we want it on the same line if possible, and if wrapping is needed, we want all of the subtitle to be below, not wrap part way through it. Role attribute -->
                    <p>One of my major reasons for building btnCode is that in web development, there is always another library, framework or technique that you want to try out, but looking things up regularly slows development.
                        This year, I decided I am learning React - a JavaScript framework with a notoriously steep learning curve. This is not only good for my skillset, but is also letting me see how much the snippet buttons help, and hopefully point to ways to make btnCode even better.
                    </p>
                    <h2>My experience with React before btnCode</h2>
                    <p>Pre-btnCode, I had completed the main part of the official tutorial, while reviewing React for a pivot of my TeaRounder project. 
                        In that phase of TeaRounder, fast development was critical, so I had to pick tools by development speed for me in the short term.</p>
                        <p>I could see how React would help in the long run, but I felt my big opportunity to pitch TeaRounder would pass before I was back up to my usual speed. This meant React didn't make the cut. I stuck with "vanilla" JavaScript with a bit of jQuery and figured I would use React some other time.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Using React through btnCode, Plan A</h2>
                    <p>By the time I decided to give React another go, btnCode was at a point where I could add snippets reasonably easily. I could add a collection of React snippets for quick and easy reference, and use btnCode alongside VSCode to work on a project. 
                        But what to work on? I was now learning React to add to my skillset, not for the needs of a specific project. The world was my oyster so to speak, I could just pick something that would benefit from React. 
                        I was enjoying working on btnCode, and I couldn't think of anything else that excited me. I decided pretty quickly - I would rebuild btnCode, in React, with the help of the original build of btnCode.
                    </p>
                    <p>This felt like a great idea at first. The btnCode codebase had been getting unweildy, and I knew that over time I wanted to keep coming back and adding to it. 
                        Two issues with the plan emerged: 
                        1) rebuilding something that you recently built, but now with a slower rate of progress, is a recipe for frustration. It is very demotivating.
                        2) I was actually needing to learn quite a bit more than just React syntax: NPM commands for running a local server and building the project, thinking in terms of components rather than HTML. 
                    </p>
                    <p>To fix those issues I needed 1) A less ambitiuous first project to warm up on, & 2) More snippet buttons!! - this time for NPM, so that seeing my code in action is a nicer process. <br>
                        <em>Don't do big ambitious projects as your first actual project with a tool!</em>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Plan B - A less ambititious</h2>
                    <p>

                    </p>
