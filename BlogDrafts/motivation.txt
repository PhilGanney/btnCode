Motivations to code.  (Draft stub, needs fleshing out)

Different people code for different combinations of reasons.

Some of my own personal motivations for working on my own projects over the years have been:
1) Strong feelings that a particular piece of software should exist. "Why does this not exist already!"
2) A general feeling of wanting to create. Preferably something useful to a number of people. "I want to make something useful"
3) Wanting to explore a concept, with an inkling that some good would come out of that exploration. "I wonder if .."
4) Seeing coding as a route into a good living - the hope that a portfolio might open up an opportunity, or the hope that an app could become profitable.
"I need money, coding can earn money right?"

I have also had jobs and contracts where I was being paid to build a given thing. Its interesting to think about how my motivation for those projects compare: 
 the desire to create and hopes of a good living spurred the initial motivation to pursue that path. 
 Feelings about some projects make some opportunities stand out over others
