			<h3>Progress: barely functional demo</h3>
			Sunday 2nd October 2022: domain online and initial prototyping.<br/>
			Monday 3rd October 2022: basic, barely functional JS demo.<br/>
			Tuesday 4th October 2022: code now goes on multiple lines - made some progress on whitespace, but turned out to be more complex than it first looked.<br/>
			Wednesday 5th October 2022: tabs are now only 4 spaces - for some reason textarea default is 8.<br/>
			Friday 7th October 2022: text indentation kinda: text inserted by the buttons will have the same number of tabs on each line as the number of tabs in a row from where the cursor was<br/>
			Monday 10th October: A) better text indentation for button made text. (Now counts tabs from last new line before cursor to first non tab character after that new line) <br/>
			B) More JS codeblock buttons<br/>
			Tuesday 11th October: Added some basic CSS buttons
			<!--<h3>Currently working on:</h3> Making the JS demo nicer to use! <br/>
			I had wanted a copy-all button, but adding to clipboard via JS requires HTTPS if not run locally, so while this is a fun little pet project that isnt going to happen. -->
