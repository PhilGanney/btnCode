				0% is the start, so set initial values
				4% is the crash point, 
					BG match initial value so that animation will not start changing the color yet
					Txt not set here - allow animation changing the value
				10% is the full deflate point when colours should finish inverting
					BG set to the Txt initial value
					Txt set to the BG initial value
				80% (actually varies by ball) is the top of the screen again point - back to initial values
					BG set to BG initial value
					Txt set to Txt initial value
				100% is end of the loop - set to initial values (100% needs to be set to prevent weird jumps at least in chrome)
					BG set to BG initial value
					Txt set to Txt initial value
